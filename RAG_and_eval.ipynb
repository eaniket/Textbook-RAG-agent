As a r esult of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced fr om its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This pr ocess continues in the\\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in tur n produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forwar d themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forwar d. This is what\\nhappens during pr opagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwar ds,\\nit creates a r egion of low pr essur e called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4.

If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.The regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium thr ough which it travels.

The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC.

This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperatur e, say at 22 ºC in air , the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperatur e of air . Echoes may be hear d\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2  A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson.

This pr ocess continues in the\\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion.

Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\\nwhich sound travels.

As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave.
